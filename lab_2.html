<ul>
    <li>I like to dye my hair, mostly red, but sometimes purple!</li>
    <li>I wear glasses! I didn't need glasses until my freshman year of high school, but sadly both of my parents are blind as bats so it was inevitable.</li>
    <li>I'm actually super allergic to cats and any dog that sheds, so living with two cats is rough, but Lila doesn't sheed!</li>
    <li>I actually really want to do a job in illustration and I'm hoping to take a few classes next semester!</li>
    <li>I have a pretty late birthday, so I'm usually always the youngest :,(</li>
